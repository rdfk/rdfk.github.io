This page is dedicated to remembering my grandmother Janice M. Schwaiger. Janice was my grandmother and took me in as her own when I was very young. She raised me and gave me love and support. My grandmother always made sure I had access to technology. My first computer was a packard bell that she purchased for me and as I grew older she always made sure that I had access to a computer which has enabled me to pursue my passions to this day. The purpose of this page is to honor her for her love and dedication that she showed me throughout her life and to live as a reminder of her caring and supportive soul.
